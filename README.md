# SVM-classifier

Used the Data SVM.csv.
Reported the following:
1. Plotted the data.
2. Trained nonlinear SVM classifier using polynomial kernel. Varied the values of C and
d (degree of polynomial) in some range. For each combination of C and d, ran 10-fold
cross validation 30 times and report the average cross validation accuracy and standard
deviation. Made a chart for that.
Found the best combination of C and d. Used these parameters and train SVM using
complete dataset. Plotted the final classifier.
3. Trained nonlinear SVM classifier for each dataset using rbf (Gaussian) kernel. Varied
the values of C and σ (width of Gaussian) in some range. For each combination of
C and σ, ran 10-fold cross validation 30 times and report the average cross validation
accuracy and standard deviation. Made a chart for that.
Found the best combination of C and σ. Used these parameters and train SVM using
complete dataset. Plotted the final classifier.
4. Compared the performances with different kernels and comment on the quality of classifiers in each case.
